    "For each question in the assignment, please write down your answer in the answer cell(s) right below the question. \n",

    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run codes, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

    "Finally, unless we state otherwise, **do not use for loops or list comprehensions**. The majority of this assignment can be done using builtin commands in Pandas and numpy.  Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be read for the midterm.\n"

Also be sure to convert the type of this column to `int`. Hint: Similar to the early problem where we used `astype(string)` to convert a column to a String, here you should use `astype(int)` to convert the `bid` column into type int.\n",

You might expect that the usual way to convert something from it current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime`.
